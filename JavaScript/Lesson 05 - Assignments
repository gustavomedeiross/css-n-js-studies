Assingment (atribuição) is when you change the value of a variable based on the current value of the same variable.

For example:

var a = 10;
a += 5;  //"+=" is the assignment
console.log(a);
>>> 15 


this:
a += 5;

is the same thing as this:
a = a + 5;

//this works for any arithmetic operation.
