Template Literals are a much easier and cleanier way if making strings concatenating.

This:

'Hello ' + name + ', are you feeling ok?'


Is going to look like this:

@ `Hello ${name}, are you feeling ok?`


You need to use the "``", and to concatenate, the syntax is "${variableOrValue}".



You don't have to use "\n" too! Example:

`Hello. This string starts on this line,

moves to this line,

and now it's down there.
isn't that nice?!`
