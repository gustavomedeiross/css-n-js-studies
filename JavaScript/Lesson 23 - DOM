DOM = Document Object Model

The document is an object that contains the whole html of the same page. But, more than that: Every html element can be a JavaScript object. This means that you can edit, create or remove html tags (and it's content) through JavaScript!

But there's a important thing to know: you can only access directly two elements: document.head | document.body
To access all the other elements, you will need to use especific methods of the document object.

Methods:

@ document.getElementById(); //returns the element
@ document.getElementsByClassName(); //returns an array of all the elements that have that class name (even if it's just one)
@ document.getElemementsByTagName(); //returns an array of all the elements that have that tag name (even if it's just one).


Examples:

<h1 class='class'>e1</h1>
<h1 id='Id'>e2</id>
<h1>e3</h1>


document.getElementById('Id);
>>> e2

document.getElementsByTagName('h1')[2];
>>> e3

document.getElementsByClassName('class')[0];
>>> e1


//the "[0]" or "[2]" is to already return the required element (of the array);
