When you're doing a request to a server, you don't know exactly how long it will take to get the response. But you know it will not be instantaneous, like the script that runs on your pc.

JavaScript is Asynchronous: This means that if something is taking time to run, JS will not await that thing to happen to start running other stuff. That's what is called Asynchronous programming.

Example:

requestFromTheServer();  //takes some time
console.log('Hello world'); //instantaneous - JS will run this line first than the request (even though the line comes first).


This can cause some issues!
