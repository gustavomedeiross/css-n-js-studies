When you're doing a request to a server, you don't know exactly how long it will take to get the response. But you know it will not be instantaneous, like the script that runs on your pc.

JavaScript is Asynchronous: This means that if something is taking some time to run, JS will not await that process to finish to start running other processes. That's what it is called Asynchronous programming.

Example:

requestFromTheServer();  //takes some time
console.log('Hello world'); //instantaneous - JS will run this line before the request (even though the line comes first).


This can cause some issues!
