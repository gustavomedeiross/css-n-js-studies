Destructuring is a very useful ES6 tool. It's widely used in ReactJS, Angular and Vue applications.

Basically is a quick way of assigning object properties to new variables, using the same variable name. Example:

const myObject = {
  name: 'Gustavo',
  age: 19,
  university: 'Unisul'
}

//this creates two variables that will store the value of "name" and "age" inside "myObject" object:

@ const {name, age} = myObject;   

console.log(name);
console.log(age);

>>> 'Gustavo'    19
