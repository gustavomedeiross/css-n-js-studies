The high-order function Map is a native method built-in all arrays.
Map is used to create a new array based on another array. It will have the same length, but the values are going to be different - you can manipulate each value of the array.

As the map method is a high-order function, it will always receive another function as an argument (and that function has an argument too - the value of the index that it's analyzing).


let myArray = ['Gustavo', 'Paulo', 'Antonino'];
@ let mapArray = myArray.map(value =>{
  return value + ' is very cool';    
});
console.log(mapArray);

>>> [ 'Gustavo is very cool', 'Paulo is very cool', 'Antonino is very cool' ]  //output

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This would be the map method from the "inside":

function newMap(callback){
    let newArray = [];
    this.forEach(value => newArray.push(callback(value)));
    return newArray;
}

//and you have to assign this function as a method of the array too
