You can use the command "querySelector" to search for an element in html using basically the same syntax as you would use in CSS - but in JavaScript.


@ document.querySelector('selector'); //returns a single element.

@ document.querySelector('selector'); //returns an array (NodeList) of elements.


//you'll need to use quotes ('') to use the selector.


If you use querySelector(); and there's more than 1 element that "respect the rules" of your selection, the method will return the first one.


*If you want to check how to use the selectors of CSS properly, you can take a look at the Lesson 29 of CSS - "Selectors".
