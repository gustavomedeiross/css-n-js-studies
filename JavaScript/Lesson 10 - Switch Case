Switch Case is conditional structure, with strict comparison (===).

@ switch(nameOfTheVariable){
  case value1:
    command block,
    break;
  
  case value2:
    command block;
    break
  default:
    command block;
    break;
}


So, explaining the syntax:
The switch will receive a variable between the parenthesis, and that variable will be the reference to our cases.

Inside the switch block, there will be case "something". That "something" will be the required value for something to happen (important: the case only supports "===", so there's no way to use >, < or !=). 

If the case is true, the command block will be executed, BUT, you need to put a "break;" at the end of the block, otherwise, all the next cases will be executed (even if they're not true).
