For this lesson we will use this example:
var date = new Date('mar 13 2000');

Date methods:

date.getFullYear();
>>> 2000


date.getDate();
>>> 13

date.getDate(); //this method returns the day of the week (in this case, monday) - it return a number, with 0 being sunday and 6 being saturday.
>>> 1
