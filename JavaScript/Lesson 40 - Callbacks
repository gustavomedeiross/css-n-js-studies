Callbacks are basically when you call a function as an argument to another function.

Example of callback:

function logA (){
  console.log('A');
}

function logAB(callback){
  callback();
  console.log('B');
}

@ logAB(logA);  //this is the callback - you're passing a function as an argument to another function.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Callbacks are useful to deal with asynchronous programming.

Let's say, you two functions: 
1 - makes a request to a server, getting an array.
2 - shows the array on the screen (DOM).

The main problem is that even if you call the function 1 before the function 2 on the script, the function 2 will run before, because the function 1 is waiting for the response of the server, while function 2 not.

But you need the array first to show it on the screen. So, you can use callbacks!
Function 1 can have a callback argument, that calls function 2 after the request is done. 

---------------------------------------

Example:

 //that's the function 1
 
function requestArray(callback){                               
  requestArrayFromTheServer();   //async, it will take an undefined amount of time
  if(request == successful){
    callback();   //now this will only run if the request is done
  }
}

requestArray(showArray); //showArray is the function 2.
