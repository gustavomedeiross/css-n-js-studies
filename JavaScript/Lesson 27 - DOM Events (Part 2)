One of the most important DOM Events is the "onload" event. 

Because the html loads on a "linear" way, so for example:

<h1>This will load before the p</h1>
<p>This will load after the h1</p>

------------------------------

This can cause some problems if you're not careful. For example:

<script>
  let h1 = document.getElementsByTagName('h1')[0];
  h1.innerHTML = 'new h1';
</script>

<h1>Original h1</h1>


//this code above will return a error - because the <h1> is not loaded yet to get it in the <script>.



You can have two solutions: 
1- Move the script code all the way down inside the body tag (So it will never load before)

2- Set a "onload" event on the body tag, and ALL the JavaScript code will happen inside the "onload" function. This makes all the <body> load first, to just after that, start running the JavaScript.
