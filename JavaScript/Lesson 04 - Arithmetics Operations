+ -> sum
- -> subtraction
* -> multiplication
/ -> division
% -> modulation
++ -> increment
-- -> decrease


//the order of the increment/decrease matters in some cases. For example:

var a = 30;
console.log(++a); //because is incrementing a before the console.log happens
>>> 31
console.log(a++); //because is doing the console.log before the increment.
>>> 30
