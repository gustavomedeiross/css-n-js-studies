As already said, almost everything in JavaScript is an object. 

The most important object in JavaScript is the object "Window". Every native method or object in a child of the object window (But you don't need to declare it everytime).

Example:

console.log('Hello, World!') === window.console.log('Hello, World!');   //both are the same thing
