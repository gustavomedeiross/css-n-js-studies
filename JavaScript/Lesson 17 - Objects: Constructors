A constructor function is a function that creat/return an object. The action to create a new object based on a model of an object is called "instantiate object". 

w3schools's tip: It is considered good practice to name constructor functions with an upper-case first letter.

There's two ways of creating constructor functions in JavaScript:

1ยบ: Return

function Constructor(arguments){
  return{
    property1: argument1,
    property2: argument2
    }
}

let newObj = Constructor(arguments);




2ยบ: This and new

function Constructor(arguments){
  this.property1 = argument1,    //in this case, you can use both "," or ";"
  this.property2 = argument2
}

let newObj = new Constructor;
