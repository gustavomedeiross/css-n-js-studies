The difference between a "do while" and a "while" loop is that the first one will always run at least one time
It's going to run first, and then see the conditional.

Example:

let a = 10;
do{
    console.log(a);
}while(a < 5);

>>> 10   //it will run once, and then check the condition. In this case, is already false, so it stops right away.
