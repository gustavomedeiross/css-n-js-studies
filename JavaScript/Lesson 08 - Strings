If you concatenate (+) a string with a number, the number will turn into a string.
example:

"Hello World" + 5;
>>> "Hello World 5"

The only operation that can be done with a string is "+" - everything else will return NaN. 
But if the content of the strings are only numbers and you do operations with them (excluding +, because it will concatenate), the operations will happen. 
example:

"5" - "3";
>>> 2

"10" + "5";
>>> "105"
