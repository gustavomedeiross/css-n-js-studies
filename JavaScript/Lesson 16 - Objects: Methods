A method is basically a function inside an object. 

Example:

//with anonymous functions

let student = {
  name: 'Gustavo';
  study: function(){command block}
}

to call the method: student.study();


--------------------------------------or-------------------------------------------------------


//with normal functions (not anonymous)

function studyFunc(){command block};

let student = {
  name: 'Gustavo'
  study: studyFunc();  //the function "studyFunc()" is already being called. If the value of "study:" was just "studyFunc" withoud the parenthesis, you would need to use the parenthesis when calling the method.
}

to call the method: student.study; //if you put "student.study()" it would return an error, because the function is already called inside the object.
