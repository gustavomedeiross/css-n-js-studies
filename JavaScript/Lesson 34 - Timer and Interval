@ setTimeout (method, timeMilliseconds); //this will make a timeout, like a little time for something to happen (just one time).

-----------------------------

@ setInterval (method, timeMilliseconds); //this will make a interval, that is going to happen continuously, until you stop it (if you stop it).

To make the interval stop it, you need to assingn the interval to a variable, so the interval has a "name".
And then, you call this method:

@ clearInterval(intervalVariable);

Example:

let inteval1 = setInterval(console.log('Stop me'), 1000); //it will happen every second.

clearInterval(interval1); //this makes the interval stop.
