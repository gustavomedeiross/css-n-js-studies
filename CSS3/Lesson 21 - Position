The position property will set how the element be showned on the screen.

@ position: static|relative|absolute|fixed|sticky;

@ top : size;
@ bottom: size;
@ right: size;
@ left: size;

These properties (top, bottom, right and left) can only work if position is set first. And depending on the position type, they will behave differently.

@ position: static; // this property is the default. Basically the element will not "move", even if you change the "top, bottom...". The elements will not be affected.

@ position: relative; // the element will be positioned relative to it's normal position. So, for example, top: 50px will move the element 50px to the bottom (because it creates 50px of "space" in the top).

@ position: absolute; //this is really useful. The position absolute will be relative to first parent that does not have a position static. So, for example:
