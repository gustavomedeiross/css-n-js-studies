The outline is basically a border, but at the same time it's not. What I mean by that is the fact that while the border is apart of the CSS box-model, the outline isn't. 
The point is: the outline will go outside the element (so, outside the border), and will be above the margin.

@ outline: style|width|color; //the outline have the exact same parameters of the border (but doesn't have the "radius" property) - you can set them individually (for example: outline-style).

@ outline-offset: size; //this sets the spacing between the outline and the edge of the border. It can not be set throught the shorthand method.

Note from w3schools: "Outline differs from borders! Unlike border, the outline is drawn outside the element's border, and may overlap other content. Also, the outline is NOT a part of the element's dimensions; the element's total width and height is not affected by the width of the outline."
