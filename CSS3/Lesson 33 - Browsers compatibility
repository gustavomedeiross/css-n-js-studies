Browsers don't update as fast as the languages (CSS, JavaScript). So, the browsers make available a prefix for you to use, if your command is not supported yet.

For example: if transform: scale() is not available yet on the new Internet Explorer, you can use

-ms-transform: scale();
or 
-moz-transform: scale();  //for mozilla
or 
-webkit-transform: scale();  //for chrome


Those sites help you know how many browsers support your command, and caniuse shows how much % of people use that browser.
If the usage is more than 1%, you should use the prefix for that browser.
