In the lesson 1 we learned how to create two states, using "from" and "to". A state -> B state.

But you can create many more states using %. For example:

@keyframes nameOfTheAnimation {
  0% {property: value1}
  33% {property: value2}
  66% {property: value3}
  100% {property: value4}
}

Now, the animation has 4 states.
