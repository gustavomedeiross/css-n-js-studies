@ animation-timing-function: values;

This will set how the animation will behave (the acceleration).

There's 5 timing functions:

@ linear; //keeps the same acceleration

@ ease; //starts and ends slowly, but gets really fast in the center

@ ease-in; //starts slowly, but gets faster in the center to end

@ ease-out; //starts fast, but gets slowly in the end

@ ease-in-out; //starts and ends slowly, but doesn't get as fast as ease in the center
