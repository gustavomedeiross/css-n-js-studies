@ animation-fill-mode: forwards|backwards|both;


Forwards will prevent the element to go back to it's "native" styling, and after the animation is done, it's going to inherit the styles of the 100%.

Backwards prevent the element to start with the style different to the 0% animation (this is just noticeable with "animation-delay").

Both will do forwards + backwards.
