@ animation-delay: Xs;

This will basically delay the start of the animation.

-------

But you can assign negative values to it. What will happen then?

animation-duration: 6s;
animation-delay: -3s;


Basically, this will make the animation starts immediately, but as if 3 seconds already passsed. 
The animation has 6 seconds total, so -3s of delay will make the animation starts at 50%.
