The transition property makes changes softer. (For example: hover, click, a JavaScript functions that changes the style, etc).

@ transition-property: property; //sets the property that is going to be affected by the transition.


@ transition-duration: Xs|Xms; //sets how much time it will take to that transition to happen.


@ transition-delay: Xs|Xms; //you can set a delay for that transition.


@ transition-timing-function: timing-function; //all those animations timing functions work here.

-----------------------------------------------------

SHORTHAND:

@ transition: property duration delay timing-function;

---

If you want to set more than one property in one shorthand:

@ transition: property1 duration delay timing-function, property2 duration delay timing-function (...);


You can use this too:

@ transition: all duration delay timing-function; 

//this will set any property that changes to make a transition - !IMPORTANT: But isn't recommended, because when using "all", the browser needs to verify what properties are transitioning. So it's bad for performance reasons.
