All animations in CSS needs 3 steps:

1- Create the animation
2- What element will be affected
3- How much time this animation will take

The animations will go from the A state to the B state.

---------------------------------------------------------

Syntax:

1- Create the animation

//this will be outside any element (this is like declaring a function)

@keyframes nameOfTheAnimation{
  from {property: value1}
  to {property: value2}
}

-----------

2- What element will be affected

//now this needs to be inside a selector

element {
  animation-name: nameOfTheAnimation; //the name of the keyframe that you created
}

------------

3- How much time this animation will take

element {
  animation-name: nameOfTheAnimation; 
  animation-duration: Xs; //the amount of seconds to go from A state to B state
}
