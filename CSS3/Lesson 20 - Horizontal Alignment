//this class doesn't consider CSS Grid or Flexbox
To align an element on the screen you must know first what is the display of that element.

If the display is block:

@ margin: auto; //it will be aligned on the center.
@ margin-left: auto; //it will be aligned on the right.
@ margin-right: auto; //it will be aligned on the left.

If the display is inline or inline-block:

You need to create a container to that element (or, if it already having it) and set this property on the container (or parent element)

@ text-align: center; //it will go to the center of the parent space.
@ text-align: right; //it will go to the right of the parent space.
@ text-align: left; //it will go to the left of the parent space.
