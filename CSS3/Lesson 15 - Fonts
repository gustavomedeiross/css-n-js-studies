There are three "root types" of font, being: Serif, Sans-serif and Monospace.

!IMPORTANT: Using fonts.google.com is a very good way to find nice-looking fonts (and is very easy to import the fonts, google already does it for you - just copy the link)

@ font-family: 'nameOfTheFont1', nameOfTheFont2, nameOfTheFont3 [...]; //if you put the commas, it means "if the browser doesn't support that font, what font will be used?" - It follows the sequence.

@ font-style: normal|italic;

@ font-size: size; //is important to use relative CSS units!

w3schools tip: Use a Combination of Percent and Em. The solution that works in all browsers, is to set a default font-size in percent for the <body> element.


@ font-weight: number
