This lesson doesn't consider Flexbox and Grid to do vertical alignment.

There's some ways to align your content vertically.

1st method - Position absolute and transform.
@ #item{
  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  transform: translateY(-50%); //this is set because the "top: 50%" is considering from the top of the element.
}

//the parent needs to be position: relative - or it will be 50% considering the body height.


2nd method - Line height.
@ #item{
  line-height: sizeOfTheParentHeight;
}

//this method is very messy, not recommended at all.


3rd method - Padding.

@ #item{
  padding-top: sizeY;
  padding-bottom: sizeY
}

//for simple things, this can work - but the main problem is that is not considering the content's height (it will be bigger than the sum of both paddings).
