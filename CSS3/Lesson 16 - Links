The links have some pseudo-classes that can be customized to make your site look better.

//links have color: blue and font-style: underline by default.

@ a:link{styles} //a normal, unvisited link.

@ a:visited{styles} //a visited link.

@ a:hover{styles} //how the link looks like when the mouse is over it.

@ a:active{styles} //how the link looks like when the user clicks the link.

!IMPORTANT: w3schools tip: When setting the style for several link states, there are some order rules: a:hover MUST come after a:link and a:visited / a:active MUST come after a:hover
