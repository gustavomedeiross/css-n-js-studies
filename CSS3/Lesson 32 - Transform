Transform is very useful for animations in CSS. Basically it will change some feature of the element.

@ transform: rotate(XDeg); //this will rotate the element - If you set a positive number, it will rotate clockwise, if you set a negative number, it will rotate anticlockwise - It uses degrees.



@ transform: scale(X); //this will change the scale of the element. So you can make an element twice as bigger (using 2) or half of the size (using 0.5) for example.

You can set scale(x, y) - this change vertically and horizontally 
Or you can use scaleX(); | scaleY();
And scale3d(x, y, z); - this will scale in 3 dimensions.



@ transform: skew(XDeg); //turns the element into a parallelogram. You can set 2 arguments, with one being the X and the other being the Y.
