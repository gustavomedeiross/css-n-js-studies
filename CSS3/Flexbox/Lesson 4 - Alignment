Those are basically the most important thing of Flexbox.

@ justify-content: value;

@ align-items: value;

They basically align vertically and horizontally the elements inside the Flexbox.

If the flex-direction is row:

justify-content is HORIZONTAL
align-items is VERTICAL


If the flex-direction is column:

justify-content is VERTICAL
align-items is HORIZONTAL

-------------------------------------------------------

Possible values for both them:

@ stretch;  //default - stretches the items, so the size can change.
@ flex-start; //starts from the start 
@ flex-end; //starts from the end
@ center; //centers the elements

@ space-around; //the same spacing for all the elements (so it will double when there is two elements).
@ space-evenly; //the same spacing for everything (border and other elements will have the same spacing).
@ space-between; //the same space for all other elements, but doesn't have any spacing for the border - so it touches the border.
