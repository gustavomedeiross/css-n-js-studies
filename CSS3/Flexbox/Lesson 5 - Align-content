The align-content changes the aligning of the extra lines that the Flexbox can create if you use wrap.

So, if one element doesn't have more space to it's "natural" size and needs to be wrapped to a new line that Flexbox will create, the "align-content" will change that line alignment.

@ align-content: center; //all the lines will be centered.

The default value is "stretch", so that's why the wrap create those extra spaces - it stretches the lines to fill everything up. If you change to any other, the lines will have only the needed size to behave the element.
