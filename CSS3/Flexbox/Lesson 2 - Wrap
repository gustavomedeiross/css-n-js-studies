By default, FlexBox shrinks elements. So, if you have 2 elements that have a width, and they will not fit on the container, they will shrink by default - they're flexible.

But if you don't want that to happen, what can you do? 

@ flex-wrap: wrap; //it will "protect" the initial size of the element - if the container is shrinked. 

But what happens if it doesn't fit anymore? - It will create a new row (if the flex-direction is row, otherwise it will create a new big column). Creating that new row, the element that doesn't fit anymore will go to this next row. It will create how many rows is needed to. 

That's good, because you want to wrap the element, but you have to be careful because this can make the elements overflow.

-----------------------------------------------------------

@ flex-wrap: wrap-reverse; //it will do the same as "wrap", but the lines will be created upside down.

This means that if the elements doesn't fit anymore, it will be above the other elements (the line 2 will be above the line 1 - in row's case) - and all the elements will be aligned to the flex-end too.
