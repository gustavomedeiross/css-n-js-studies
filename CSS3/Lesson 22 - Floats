Ok, to start off, is really important to say that using floats to create layouts in CSS is a big workaround. Nobody in 2019 should use float to create layouts actually (maybe in really specific cases, I don't know).

Originally float was created just for the purpose of making images float in a specific corner of your screeen, and making text "hug" the image - just like a newspaper or a magazine would do. Later, when the internet started to create it's own style of design, float started to be used for different things.

Nowdays, there are way easier forms of doing web layouts - for example CSS Grid and Flexbox. But anyway, is nice to know it.


@ float: left|right|none|inherit; //makes the element (even a display: block) float. If a element is set with float: left, the next element of the document flow will be placed on the right of that element - the left element will float.

@ clear: left|right|both|none; //this property preventes a element to "float" on the other side. Example: if you have the element1 (with float: left) and you don't want the element2 to go on the right of the element1 (to float on it's right), you can set "clear: left or both". - both will make the element never float on any side.

//the clear left only works when the element have display block.




The major usage of float is to make web layouts and menus.
@ nav {float: right} //makes the navigation menu go to the right.
@ li {float: left} //makes an unordered list horizontal (just like a menu header). 



Sometimes, when creating layouts, a problem can appear: You set the float: left for the li (to make a menu, for example), and the next element (that is not in the ul) goes on the right of your element. You can think of using clear: both, and majority of time this will work. BUT, there's a better/safer way of doing it:  //this is called "the clearfix hack" or just "clearfix"
@ li::after{
  content: '';
  clear: both;
  display: table;
}

//there's another old way of doing this "clearfix hack" - using overflow: auto. But the main problem is that you need to have control of your margins and paddings.
