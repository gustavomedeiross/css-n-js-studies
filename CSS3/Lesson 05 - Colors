In CSS, you have 4 ways to set a color: name of the color, rgb, rgba and hexadecimal.

@ color: colorOfTheFont //this command sets the color of the Font.

!IMPORTANT: You can use the color "transparent".

@ color: nameOfTheColor //some colors have their name in CSS (ex: White).
@ color: rgb (0, 255, 255) //in rgb, the values need to be between 0 and 255 - r = red, g = green and b = blue.
@ color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1) //a is basically the opacity - the value of opacity needs to be between 0 and 1.
@ color: #a1b2c3 //hexadecimal works just like rgb but have a different syntax and the values between 0 and FF (0 and 255)
