In CSS you can use some properties to change the style of your text. Let's see them:

@ color: color; //changes the text color.

@ text-align: left|right|center|justify; //this property aligns the text (it's realy self explanatory).

!IMPORTANT: The "text-align: center" can be used to center the content of some container (if the content have the display: inline or inline-block).

@ text-decorantion: none|overline|underline|linethrough; //this property sets if the text will have any lines (like underlines).

@ text-transform: uppercase|lowercase|capitalize; //specifies if the text will be in uppercase, lowercase or capitalized. The CSS is the correct way to change these kind of things, using html to set uppercase will be a mess.

@ text-indent: size; //sets the indentation of the first line in the text (parágrafo - é o famoso 2 dedinhos).

@ letter-spacing: size; //sets the space between the letters in the text.

@ line-height: size; //sets the space between the lines.

@ direction: rtl; //this command literally reverses the text (as if the text-space was mirrored).

@ word-spacing: size; //space between words.

@ text-shadow: positionOfTheHorizontalShadow positionOfTheVerticalShadow colorOfTheShadow; //this property sets a shadow to the text. The "positionOfTheHorizontalShadow" is done using size units (px, for example).
