In CSS you can use some properties to change the style of your text. Let's see them:

@ color: color; //changes the text color.

@ text-align: left|right|center|justify; //this property aligns the text (it's realy self explanatory).

!IMPORTANT: The "text-align: center" can be used to center the content of some container
