The relative units are essential to do responsive websites. They work - as the name already tells - relative to a value (it can be related to a fixed or other relative value).

@ em //is relative to the font-size of the parent element. It works in any type of element, but ALWAYS will be based on the font-size (even if the property you are changing the size is not the actual font-size - for example: you can use with width or height).
@ rem //is the same thing as the em, but this time it will be only the ROOT element (:root or html). So, the font-size of the parent element doesn't matter when using the rem (unless your parent is the actual html - but you got the point). The default font-size of the html is 16px.

//the em is really useful, but the main "danger" is the fact that it is easily coumpaundable. That's why rem was originally created for.
//if you want to do a thing that is a little bit more "continuous", use rem (it's way better to use rems rather than px).
//if you want to do something a little bit more "flexible", use em.

//rems work really well with media queries! (just change the html font-size in the media queries)


!IMPORTANT: The em will first search if the font-size of the current element wasn't already changed. If it was, the basis value of the em will be the font-size of the element itself, not the parent (7:00 of Kevin Powell's video about ems and rems).


@ vw //is relative to the viewport width. 1vw is 1% of the viewport width (viewport = size of the window browser).
@ vh //the same as vw, but the height.

//vh can be useful for setting the height of things (for example, the background) and some titles (but you'll need media queries)


@ vmin //the same as vw/vh, but is relative to the smaller window dimension (if the width is smaller than the height, it will be the width. if the width becomes bigger, it will be the height).
@ vmax //the same as vmin, but in this case is the biggest window dimension.

//is really rare to use these kinds of units, but you can use to set the size of titles (with vmin), because you don't need to set the media queries to the really big screens.

@ % //the percentage is relative to the parent element .this time, the property matters. for example, if the width of the parent is 200px, 50% of the children will be 100px (but only the width).

w3schools tip: "The em and rem units are practical in creating perfectly scalable layout!"
