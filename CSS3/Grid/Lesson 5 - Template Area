The grid-template-areas is a very powerful way of templating your grid. It can be very useful for maintenance and media queries (for responsive mobile devices).

@ grid-template-areas: 'template';

------------------------------------

Is very simple to use it. You need to set the "name" of the children of the container using this:

@ grid-area: 'name1'; //this goes on one the of children, and they all need to have'em.

After this, you can just template in the 'grid-template-areas:'. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Example:

container{
  grid-template-areas:                  
  'c2 c1 c1'
  'c2 c3 c3'                         
  'c3 c3 c3';
}

//down there I'm assigning the names of the children to use it on the grid-template-areas.

child1{
  grid-area: 'c1';
}
child2{
  grid-area: 'c2';
}
child3{
  grid-area: 'c3';
}


//this will template the grid: so it's a grid of 3 columns and 3 rows, and the order of the elements is set on the grid-template-areas. (One of the coolest things is that it's very visual).
