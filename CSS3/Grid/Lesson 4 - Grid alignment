@ justify-content: value;

@ align-content: value;


Both of them have a default value of stretch. What these properties do is basically change the alignment of the grid itself.

So, as they have the default value of stretch, the grid is stretched to all the container - but if you set it to flex-start (for example), ALL the grid will go to the flex-start and the size of the grid will be the required size to fill all the elements (without changing the size of them).

You can use all those position Flexbox values.
