The grid gap will create a space between the elements - like a "margin".

@ grid-row-gap: size; //creates space between the rows.

@ grid-column-gap: size; //creates space between the columns.




If the gap is the same on both columns and rows, you can use:

@ grid-gap: size; //this will be applied to rows and columns.
