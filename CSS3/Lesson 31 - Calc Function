The Calc function basically does math for you. 

@ width: calc(x - y);

For example, if you want to set the height to 100%, but - 500px: you can do that using the calc Function

height: calc(100% - 500px).

!IMPORTANT - The display "inline" and "inline-block" have a spacing with 4px. So it will be always 4px bigger than a block element, for example. You can use the calc() to resolve this:

width(100% - 4px);
