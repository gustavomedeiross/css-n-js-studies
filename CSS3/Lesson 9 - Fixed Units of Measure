In CSS there are two types of measures: Fixed and relative (reference). Nowdays, with the sites working on different platforms, it's better to use the relative measures, but sometimes you'll NEED to use the fixed ones.
Types of measures:

@ cm|mm|in
@ px
@ pt|pc //a pt (point) can sometimes have the same size of a pixel, depending on the display quality. The pc (picas) is basically 10pc (points)
