# FrontendStudies
The objective of this repository is to store my studies about Frontend Web Development. At the time of the creation of this repository, I'm doing ProgramadorBR's Frontend course, which teaches about HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, BootStrap, React and some other stuff. I'll be updating about new books, Youtube channels, courses or any other stuff that brings considerable Frontend knowlege to me.


Throughout the notes, I will follow a semantic/structural pattern. The rules are set here:
  1 -> Any text that doesn't start with symbols or special characters are basically concepts about the main topic;
  2 -> @ something - is a new command, attribute, or anything that goes directly in the code. Keeping it simple: It's the Syntax;
  3 -> // - is a comment, normally an important note for the syntax, or what it does exactly;
  4 -> !IMPORTANT - is used just in REALLY important things.
