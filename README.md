# Studies

At first, this was just to keep my studies about Frontend web development (HTML, CSS and Javascript). But now, this repository is going to be about any new concepts that I learn about programming in general, wheter being frontend, backend, mobile, databases or any technology that I found interesting and want to store it's concepts here.


Throughout the notes, I will follow a semantic/structural pattern. The rules are set here:
  1 -> Any text that doesn't start with symbols or special characters are basically concepts about the main topic;
  2 -> @ something - is a new command, attribute, or anything that goes directly in the code. Keeping it simple: It's the Syntax;
  3 -> // - is a comment, normally an important note for the syntax, or what it does exactly;
  4 -> !IMPORTANT - is used just in REALLY important things.
  5 -> >>> - output (terminal/console)
