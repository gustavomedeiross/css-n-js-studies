# FrontendStudies
The objective of this repository is to maintain my studies about Frontend Web Development. At the time of the creation of this repository, I'm doing ProgramadorBR's Frontend course, which teaches about HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, BootStrap, React and some other stuff. I'll be updating about any new books, Youtube channels, courses or any other stuff that brings considerable Frontend knowlege for me.


Throughout the notes, I will follow a semantic/structural pattern. The rules are set here:
  1 -> Any text that doesn't start with symbols or special characters are basically concecpts about the main topic;
  2 -> @ something - is going to be a new command, attribute, anything that goes directly in the code. Keeping it simple: Is      the Syntax;
  3 -> <!-- -->, /* or // - are going to be a comment, normally a important note for the syntax;
  4 -> !IMPORTANT - It's going to be used just in REALLLY important things. Messing around with this one is not a great idea.
